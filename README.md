## Intro
This program can be used to calculate grades for classes with a variety of different 
grading schemes. It accepts specially formatted .txt files or can be used exclusively 
with user input. 
## Grade File Format
Classes are separated into sections(like Homework, Quizzes, Exams)
and in a file each section takes up a single line. The name of the section is first,
followed by the percentage of the class grade it constitutes, then the number of
assignments, and then each grade in the section. Each value is followed by a comma.
The number of assignments can be set to a different number if assignments in a 
section are unequally weighted, so as to get a correct value for the overall section.
